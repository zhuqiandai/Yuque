    > ABC News:

    A court in northern China sentenced a man, surnamed Chen, to 24 years in jail Friday for his role in a vicious attack on four women, as well as other crimes including robbery and running an illegal gambling ring.

    Authorities had started the investigation into Chen after a video came to light in early June in which he and some other men started beating up four women at a barbecue restaurant in Tangshan, a city in Hebei. The men spared no force, using glass bottles and their fists to attack the women and even throwing a chair.
